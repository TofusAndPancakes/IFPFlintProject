                <h2>VISIT THE PROJECT</h2>
                <p>Flint Inc. is a video game UI mockup that people can experience with the aim of informing people of addiction in video
                games. The mock-up features UI practices which research has suggested to be addicting or incentivizing the use of an
                app. Moreover, to set Flint Inc. apart, Flint Inc. has its own world, style and characters which greatly influence the
                style of the UI.</p>

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>In this project, game addiction was defined as “excessive and compulsive use of computer and video games that results in
                social and/or emotional problems” (Lemmens et al. 2009 cited by Chang et al. 2020).
                <br><br>
                Hasriandry and Wahyuni (2021) suggested various factors that may lead to game addiction. Players that are more prone to
                being addicted to video games include, players with motivation to play for escapism and achievement, players with lower
                self-control and players with narcistic personality who may use wealth and skill to meet their need of attention from
                others.
                <br><br>
                Research on video games reveal suggestions on why games can be addicting. Koster (through Stuart 2011) suggested that
                learning is the drug in video games. He suggested that games have no penalties for mistakes which may urge players to
                try new things and keep them occupied. Moreover, one of the goals of a game developer is to make players reach flow
                state. Flow state is achieved by having narrow margin of challenge between boredom and frustration (Schell 2008). When a
                player enters a flow state, the player will lose track of time and is completely immersed in the activity they are in.
                The current researcher suggested that flow state is one of the reasons video games can be addicting.
                <br><br>
                A field of research that is relevant to this project is gamification. Bunchball through Wu (2023) provided a useful
                table that groups video game mechanics with human desire that it fulfills (see Figure 1).
                <br><br>
                A game mechanic that the current researcher wanted to make people aware is gacha, a game mechanic that can be argued to
                introduce gambling addiction. Gacha is a game mechanic where player spends in-game or real-world currency for a chance
                to obtain certain items which may introduce new mechanics into their game. The current researcher suggested that gacha
                can be perceived as “lootboxes” or “suprise bags”. Gacha mechanic is used in many freemium video games as it is
                profitable. (Spicemart 2016 cited by Koeder et al. 2017). Moreover, research on gacha that can be purchased for a
                limited time suggested that it may cause players to spend more money (six months later) (Shibuya 2019).
                <br><br>
                Other than research into video game addiction, gamification and gacha mechanics, the current researcher researched UI
                and UX good practices such as The Design of Everyday Things (Norman 1988*), 10 Principles of a Good Design by Dieter Raum
                (Faranello 2016), The 15 Fundamental Properties of Wholeness by Christopher Alexander (Farenello 2016) and Gutenberg
                Principle (Kramarzewski et al. 2018). These practices are implemented to the UI mock-up.</p>

                <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
                <p>To achieve the aim of “informing people of addiction in video games”, the current researcher settled on creating a video
                game UI. The video game UI implemented the research he has conducted, showing various features that may induce addiction
                and add a button that allows users to read the research that has gone behind the UI decisions done. The following is a
                short explanation of the various features and the research behind them:
                <br><br>
                <b>Multiple chapters and levels, each with objectives</b>
                <br>
                Dividing the game into levels and chapters, each level harder than before is an attempt to achieve flow state and hook
                players to playing the game longer.
                <br><br>
                <b>Allies (Character Gallery), Menu Customization, Profile Customization</b>
                <br>
                Having the ability to quickly see digital goods players have obtained and use them to modify the player’s in-game
                appearance is an attempt to fulfill the human desire of self-expression. Certain players have the need to collect and
                see how others are doing. This is a gamification strategy that may incentivice people to play the game.
                <br><br>
                <b>Network (Gacha)</b>
                <br>
                Adding gacha and making it the method of obtaining new characters is an attempt to rope people to get addicted to
                gambling.
                <br><br>
                <b>Friends</b>
                <br>
                Other than for self-expression, the ability to see another person’s progress to compare to himself/herself is an attempt
                to fulfill the human need of competition. For people with narcissistic personalities, this may make them addicted to the
                game.
                <br><br>
                <b>Achievement</b>
                <br>
                Adding achievements to the game adds goals for players to do short-term or long-term. Achievement is an attempt to
                fulfill the human needs to challenges and this may make players addicted to the game.

                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>Implementing research into the UI design process has given the creator new insights into games and their UI.
                <br><br>
                Due to time constraints, the mock-up UI undergoed very little user testing. The creator hopes that other creators or
                researchers may continue research into how UI and video game mechanics can create addiction in video games. The creator
                argues that this is important as games with arguably addictive mechanics are starting to reach more people.</p>
